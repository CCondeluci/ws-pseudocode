# Cards

A collection of scripted WS card pseudocode for purely for archival purposes.

## Information

This repository is meant to preserve and perpetuate the hard work of many developers who have developed WS card pseudocode. It is not meant to be a singular source for card data files, but may be freely used as a resource in the case that their work somehow is no longer freely available. Obviously, this repository is not plug-and-play for any "resources" you may have to leverage the psuedocode contained within- you will have to acquire missing pieces elsewhere.

## I want to write card pseudocode, how do I start?

The easiest way to get started is to code by example! WS is a game where many effect profiles are repeated with minor differences- searching the repository for examples is often the best (and most code-consistent) way to develop.
